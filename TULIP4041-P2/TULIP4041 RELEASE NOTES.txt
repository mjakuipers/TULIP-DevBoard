The TULIP4041 soft- and hardware is released under the MIT copyright license

VERSION 0.92 BETA 2, July 2025
-   Fixed issue with autoplug
-   Added command 'printer irtog' to toggle IR LED on or off constanty to facilitate current measurement
-   Added command 'system gpio' to list all GPIO's
-   Updated to Pico SDK V2.2.0

VERSION 0.91 BETA 2, July 2025
-   Various changes under the hood to prepare for MOD files and Tracer enhancements

Functional changes:
-   Support for Bank Switching and loading .ROM files in individual Banks
-   Support for ZEPROM Sticky Bank Switching (use the CLI emulate command to enable)
-   Flexible sizing of Trace Buffer (change requires restart)
-   A ROM can now be plugged with a Page nmber. This works only for Bank 1
    and the first available Page is used
-   The reserve command is added to reserve a Page for a physical Module
    Plugging without a Page number respects this reservation

VERSION 0.9 BETA 1, June 2025
-   Public beta, second version for the Pico2-RP2350
-   Updated to the Pico SDK 2.1.0
-   FatFS no-OS-FatFS-SD-SDIO-SPI-RPi-Pico Version 3.7.0
-   USBD_PID Manufacturere and Product ID updated for TULIP4041
-   Development tree with versions for DevBoard and Module, two binaries!
-   uSD card will automatically mount and connect to host computer
-   Many changes under the hood to prepare for the Module version, MOD files and Bank Switching

Functional changes:
-   SDCard FAT and exFAT supported, subdirectories and dir command
-   FLASH File system with NUKEALL, INIT, delete, dump, list and import functions
-   FRAM management functions, initialization and dump
-   plug and unplug functions, ROM mapping stored in FRAM
-   cat function
-   emulate function
-   HP-IL, IL Printer and 82143A Printer still embedded and easy to plug without import in FLASH
-   tracer now registers active bank
-   RTC support in the firmware for the Module using I2C

Limitations:
-   uSD card must be >2 GByte
-   No Bank Switching
-   Only ROM files supported for plugging
-   NO power management!
-   exFAT file system on the uSD card is recommended, FAT seems to be slow when registering with the host PC

READ THE DOCUMENTATION BEFORE USE!
