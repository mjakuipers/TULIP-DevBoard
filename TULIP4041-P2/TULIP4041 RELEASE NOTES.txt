-   Placeholder

VERSION 0.93 BETA 3, September 2025
-   Fixed issue with reserving Page 5, 6, 7
-   Increased GPIO drive strength for IR LED to 12 mA
-   Added support for MOD file plugging
-   Added import UPDATE and compare functions for mass update from a directory on the uSD card into FLASH
-   Cosmetic changes to the cat listing

VERSION 0.92 BETA 2, July 2025
-   Fixed issue with autoplug
-   Added command 'printer irtog' to toggle IR LED on or off constanty to facilitate current measurement
-   Added command 'system gpio' to list all GPIO's
-   Updated to Pico SDK V2.2.0

VERSION 0.91 BETA 2, July 2025
-   Various changes under the hood to prepare for MOD files and Tracer enhancements

Functional changes:
-   Support for Bank Switching and loading .ROM files in individual Banks
-   Support for ZEPROM Sticky Bank Switching (use the CLI emulate command to enable)
-   Flexible sizing of Trace Buffer (change requires restart)
-   A ROM can now be plugged with a Page nmber. This works only for Bank 1
    and the first available Page is used
-   The reserve command is added to reserve a Page for a physical Module
    Plugging without a Page number respects this reservation

VERSION 0.9 BETA 1, June 2025
-   Public beta, second version for the Pico2-RP2350
-   Updated to the Pico SDK 2.1.0
-   FatFS no-OS-FatFS-SD-SDIO-SPI-RPi-Pico Version 3.7.0
-   USBD_PID Manufacturere and Product ID updated for TULIP4041
-   Development tree with versions for DevBoard and Module, two binaries!
-   uSD card will automatically mount and connect to host computer
-   Many changes under the hood to prepare for the Module version, MOD files and Bank Switching

Functional changes:
-   SDCard FAT and exFAT supported, subdirectories and dir command
-   FLASH File system with NUKEALL, INIT, delete, dump, list and import functions
-   FRAM management functions, initialization and dump
-   plug and unplug functions, ROM mapping stored in FRAM
-   cat function
-   emulate function
-   HP-IL, IL Printer and 82143A Printer still embedded and easy to plug without import in FLASH
-   tracer now registers active bank
-   RTC support in the firmware for the Module using I2C

Limitations:
-   uSD card must be >2 GByte
-   No Bank Switching
-   Only ROM files supported for plugging
-   NO power management!
-   exFAT file system on the uSD card is recommended, FAT seems to be slow when registering with the host PC

READ THE DOCUMENTATION BEFORE USE!

USB virtual serial port assignment
-   ITF 0		main console, user interface
-   ITF 1		trace output HP41 bus tracer 
-   IFT 2		HP-IL frames (connect with ILPer or pyILPer  )
-   ITF 3		HP-IL frame tracing
-   ITF 4		Printer output for HP82143A

The UART on GPIO 0 and 1 is used by the 'old' user interface and can be 
used for simple monitoring. DO NOT USE THE FLASH FUNCTIONS!

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
This is a preliminary public BETA release. 
The sources contain may functions that are still in development and very subject to changes
Please report any issues on the github issue tracker.

The .uf2 file is ready to be loaded in the Pico.
